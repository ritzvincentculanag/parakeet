# Tell Bee

This is a remake of my first full-stack project way back in 2021 that was deleted by heroku. The original project is called Larea (idk why I called it like that lol). It was supposed to be just a simple confession board for valentines. It was made using `python` and `django` as the back-end framework and `bootstrap` on the front-end.

This remake will be using `php` as its back-end language and just html and scss on the front-end to make the stack simple. Why `php`? I just wanted to explore new things outside my comfort zone.
