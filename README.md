This project is a remake of my first ever full-stack project called Larea way back 2021. I made that project for valentines day so that people can say what they want in the website anonymously or by using their own name. 

It was made using Python and Django on the backend and Bootstrap on the frontend. It has a very basic CRUD functionality.

This remake will also utilize Python and Django in the backend. But for the front-end it'll be a little different. I will only use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for styling. Why? This is to practice my front-end skills as well and to enhance my foundations in the frontend. Another reason why I want to use those technologie on the front-end is because of simplicity. There are no additional setups packages that you need to install, etc. Just write it and watch it. Simple as that.
