This project is a remake of my first ever full-stack project called Larea way back 2021. I made that project for
valentines day so that people can say what they want in the website anonymously or by using their own name.

It was made using Python and Django on the backend and Bootstrap on the frontend. It has a very basic CRUD
functionality. This remake will also utilize Python and Django in the backend. But for the front-end it'll be a little
different. I will only use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for styling.
